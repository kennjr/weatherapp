# Weatherapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.
An application that allows you to search for the weather of any city.

## Description

The app is fairly basic, with a main page, history page and history_item page. Whenever a user searches for a city's weather the result is stored in the localStorage for future reference. We give the user realtime weather info from an api( https://www.weatherapi.com/ ).
